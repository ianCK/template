Maximum flow with lower & upper bound from $s$ to $t$:

1. For each edge $(x, y, l, u)$, connect $x \to y$ with capacity $u - l$.
2. For each node $u$, denote $d[u]$ as the difference between the sum of incoming lower bounds and the sum of outgoing lower bounds. If $d[u] > 0$, connect $S \to u$ with capacity $d[u]$, otherwise connect $u \to T$ with capacity $-d[u]$.
3. Connect $t\to s$ with capacity $\infty$.
4. Let $k$ be the sum of all $in[u] > 0$. If $Maxflow(S, T) \neq k$, there's no solution.
5. Otherwise, $Maxflow(s, t)$ is the maxflow from $s$ to $t$.
6. Furthermore, let $ff$ be the flow on $t\to s$. Remove this edge and run $f = Maxflow(t, s)$. $ff - f$ is the minimum flow from $s$ to $t$.

Minimum vertex cover on bipartite graph =
Maximum matching on bipartite graph =
Max flow with source to one side, other side to sink

To reconstruct the minimum vertex cover, dfs from each
unmatched vertex on the left side and with unused edges
only. Equivalently, dfs from source with unused edges
only and without visiting sink. Then, a vertex is chosen
iff. it is on the left side and without visited or on
the right side and visited through dfs.

Maximum density subgraph $(\sum W_e + \sum W_v) / |V|$

Binary search on answer:
For a fixed $D$, construct a Max flow model as follows:
Let $S$ be the sum of all weights (or $\infty$)

1. from source to each node with $cap = S$
2. For each $(u,v,w)$ in $E$, add $(u->v,cap=w)$ and $(v->u,cap=w)$
3. For each node $v$, from $v$ to sink with $cap = S + 2 * D - deg_v - 2 * (w_v)$

where $deg_v = \sum_{j} w_{v, j}$
If $maxflow < S * |V|$, $D$ is an answer.

Requiring subgraph: all vertex can be reached from source with
edge whose cap > 0.
